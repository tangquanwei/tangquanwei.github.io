## Getting Started

Enable the extension (do this once in each database where you want to use it)

```tsql
CREATE EXTENSION vector;
```

Create a vector column with 3 dimensions

```sql
CREATE TABLE items (id bigserial PRIMARY KEY, embedding vector(3));
```

Insert vectors

```sql
INSERT INTO items (embedding) VALUES ('[1,2,3]'), ('[4,5,6]');
```

Get the nearest neighbors by L2 distance

```sql
SELECT * FROM items ORDER BY embedding <-> '[3,1,2]' LIMIT 5;
```

Also supports inner product (`<#>`) and cosine distance (`<=>`)

Note: `<#>` returns the negative inner product since Postgres only supports `ASC` order index scans on operators

## Storing

Create a new table with a vector column

```sql
CREATE TABLE items (id bigserial PRIMARY KEY, embedding vector(3));
```

Or add a vector column to an existing table

```sql
ALTER TABLE items ADD COLUMN embedding vector(3);
```

Insert vectors

```sql
INSERT INTO items (embedding) VALUES ('[1,2,3]'), ('[4,5,6]');
```

Or load vectors in bulk using `COPY` ([example](https://github.com/pgvector/pgvector-python/blob/master/examples/bulk_loading.py))

```sql
COPY items (embedding) FROM STDIN WITH (FORMAT BINARY);
```

Upsert vectors

```sql
INSERT INTO items (id, embedding) VALUES (1, '[1,2,3]'), (2, '[4,5,6]')
    ON CONFLICT (id) DO UPDATE SET embedding = EXCLUDED.embedding;
```

Update vectors

```sql
UPDATE items SET embedding = '[1,2,3]' WHERE id = 1;
```

Delete vectors

```sql
DELETE FROM items WHERE id = 1;
```

## Querying

Get the nearest neighbors to a vector

```sql
SELECT * FROM items ORDER BY embedding <-> '[3,1,2]' LIMIT 5;
```

Get the nearest neighbors to a row

```sql
SELECT * FROM items WHERE id != 1 ORDER BY embedding <-> (SELECT embedding FROM items WHERE id = 1) LIMIT 5;
```

Get rows within a certain distance

```sql
SELECT * FROM items WHERE embedding <-> '[3,1,2]' < 5;
```

Note: Combine with `ORDER BY` and `LIMIT` to use an index

#### Distances

Get the distance

```sql
SELECT embedding <-> '[3,1,2]' AS distance FROM items;
```

For inner product, multiply by -1 (since `<#>` returns the negative inner product)

```tsql
SELECT (embedding <#> '[3,1,2]') * -1 AS inner_product FROM items;
```

For cosine similarity, use 1 - cosine distance

```sql
SELECT 1 - (embedding <=> '[3,1,2]') AS cosine_similarity FROM items;
```

#### Aggregates

Average vectors

```sql
SELECT AVG(embedding) FROM items;
```

Average groups of vectors

```sql
SELECT category_id, AVG(embedding) FROM items GROUP BY category_id;
```

## Indexing

By default, pgvector performs exact nearest neighbor search, which provides perfect recall.

You can add an index to use approximate nearest neighbor search, which trades some recall for speed. Unlike typical indexes, you will see different results for queries after adding an approximate index.

Supported index types are:

- [HNSW](#hnsw) - added in 0.5.0
- [IVFFlat](#ivfflat)

## HNSW

An HNSW index creates a multilayer graph. It has better query performance than IVFFlat (in terms of speed-recall tradeoff), but has slower build times and uses more memory. Also, an index can be created without any data in the table since there isn’t a training step like IVFFlat.

Add an index for each distance function you want to use.

L2 distance

```sql
CREATE INDEX ON items USING hnsw (embedding vector_l2_ops);
```

Inner product

```sql
CREATE INDEX ON items USING hnsw (embedding vector_ip_ops);
```

Cosine distance

```sql
CREATE INDEX ON items USING hnsw (embedding vector_cosine_ops);
```

Vectors with up to 2,000 dimensions can be indexed.

### Index Options

Specify HNSW parameters

- `m` - the max number of connections per layer (16 by default)
- `ef_construction` - the size of the dynamic candidate list for constructing the graph (64 by default)

```sql
CREATE INDEX ON items USING hnsw (embedding vector_l2_ops) WITH (m = 16, ef_construction = 64);
```

A higher value of `ef_construction` provides better recall at the cost of index build time / insert speed.

### Query Options

Specify the size of the dynamic candidate list for search (40 by default)

```sql
SET hnsw.ef_search = 100;
```

A higher value provides better recall at the cost of speed.

Use `SET LOCAL` inside a transaction to set it for a single query

```sql
BEGIN;
SET LOCAL hnsw.ef_search = 100;
SELECT ...
COMMIT;
```

### Index Build Time

Indexes build significantly faster when the graph fits into `maintenance_work_mem`

```sql
SET maintenance_work_mem = '8GB';
```

A notice is shown when the graph no longer fits

```text
NOTICE:  hnsw graph no longer fits into maintenance_work_mem after 100000 tuples
DETAIL:  Building will take significantly more time.
HINT:  Increase maintenance_work_mem to speed up builds.
```

Note: Do not set `maintenance_work_mem` so high that it exhausts the memory on the server

Like other index types, it’s faster to create an index after loading your initial data

Starting with 0.6.0, you can also speed up index creation by increasing the number of parallel workers (2 by default)

```sql
SET max_parallel_maintenance_workers = 7; -- plus leader
```

For a large number of workers, you may also need to increase `max_parallel_workers` (8 by default)

### Indexing Progress

Check [indexing progress](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/progress-reporting.html#CREATE-INDEX-PROGRESS-REPORTING) with Postgres 12+

```sql
SELECT phase, round(100.0 * blocks_done / nullif(blocks_total, 0), 1) AS "%" FROM pg_stat_progress_create_index;
```

The phases for HNSW are:

1. `initializing`
2. `loading tuples`

## IVFFlat

An IVFFlat index divides vectors into lists, and then searches a subset of those lists that are closest to the query vector. It has faster build times and uses less memory than HNSW, but has lower query performance (in terms of speed-recall tradeoff).

Three keys to achieving good recall are:

1. Create the index *after* the table has some data
2. Choose an appropriate number of lists - a good place to start is `rows / 1000` for up to 1M rows and `sqrt(rows)` for over 1M rows
3. When querying, specify an appropriate number of [probes](#query-options) (higher is better for recall, lower is better for speed) - a good place to start is `sqrt(lists)`

Add an index for each distance function you want to use.

L2 distance

```sql
CREATE INDEX ON items USING ivfflat (embedding vector_l2_ops) WITH (lists = 100);
```

Inner product

```sql
CREATE INDEX ON items USING ivfflat (embedding vector_ip_ops) WITH (lists = 100);
```

Cosine distance

```sql
CREATE INDEX ON items USING ivfflat (embedding vector_cosine_ops) WITH (lists = 100);
```

Vectors with up to 2,000 dimensions can be indexed.

### Query Options

Specify the number of probes (1 by default)

```sql
SET ivfflat.probes = 10;
```

A higher value provides better recall at the cost of speed, and it can be set to the number of lists for exact nearest neighbor search (at which point the planner won’t use the index)

Use `SET LOCAL` inside a transaction to set it for a single query

```sql
BEGIN;
SET LOCAL ivfflat.probes = 10;
SELECT ...
COMMIT;
```

### Index Build Time

Speed up index creation on large tables by increasing the number of parallel workers (2 by default)

```sql
SET max_parallel_maintenance_workers = 7; -- plus leader
```

For a large number of workers, you may also need to increase `max_parallel_workers` (8 by default)

### Indexing Progress

Check [indexing progress](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/progress-reporting.html#CREATE-INDEX-PROGRESS-REPORTING) with Postgres 12+

```sql
SELECT phase, round(100.0 * tuples_done / nullif(tuples_total, 0), 1) AS "%" FROM pg_stat_progress_create_index;
```

The phases for IVFFlat are:

1. `initializing`
2. `performing k-means`
3. `assigning tuples`
4. `loading tuples`

Note: `%` is only populated during the `loading tuples` phase

## Filtering

There are a few ways to index nearest neighbor queries with a `WHERE` clause

```sql
SELECT * FROM items WHERE category_id = 123 ORDER BY embedding <-> '[3,1,2]' LIMIT 5;
```

Create an index on one [or more](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/indexes-multicolumn.html) of the `WHERE` columns for exact search

```sql
CREATE INDEX ON items (category_id);
```

Or a [partial index](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/indexes-partial.html) on the vector column for approximate search

```sql
CREATE INDEX ON items USING hnsw (embedding vector_l2_ops) WHERE (category_id = 123);
```

Use [partitioning](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/ddl-partitioning.html) for approximate search on many different values of the `WHERE` columns

```sql
CREATE TABLE items (embedding vector(3), category_id int) PARTITION BY LIST(category_id);
```

## Hybrid Search

Use together with Postgres [full-text search](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/textsearch-intro.html) for hybrid search.

```sql
SELECT id, content FROM items, plainto_tsquery('hello search') query
    WHERE textsearch @@ query ORDER BY ts_rank_cd(textsearch, query) DESC LIMIT 5;
```

You can use [Reciprocal Rank Fusion](https://github.com/pgvector/pgvector-python/blob/master/examples/hybrid_search_rrf.py) or a [cross-encoder](https://github.com/pgvector/pgvector-python/blob/master/examples/hybrid_search.py) to combine results.

## Performance

### Tuning

Use a tool like [PgTune](https://pgtune.leopard.in.ua/) to set initial values for Postgres server parameters.

### Loading

Use `COPY` for bulk loading data ([example](https://github.com/pgvector/pgvector-python/blob/master/examples/bulk_loading.py)).

```sql
COPY items (embedding) FROM STDIN WITH (FORMAT BINARY);
```

Add any indexes *after* loading the initial data for best performance.

### Indexing

See index build time for [HNSW](#index-build-time) and [IVFFlat](#index-build-time-1).

In production environments, create indexes concurrently to avoid blocking writes.

```sql
CREATE INDEX CONCURRENTLY ...
```

### Querying

Use `EXPLAIN ANALYZE` to debug performance.

```sql
EXPLAIN ANALYZE SELECT * FROM items ORDER BY embedding <-> '[3,1,2]' LIMIT 5;
```

#### Exact Search

To speed up queries without an index, increase `max_parallel_workers_per_gather`.

```sql
SET max_parallel_workers_per_gather = 4;
```

If vectors are normalized to length 1 (like [OpenAI embeddings](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/embeddings/which-distance-function-should-i-use)), use inner product for best performance.

```tsql
SELECT * FROM items ORDER BY embedding <#> '[3,1,2]' LIMIT 5;
```

#### Approximate Search

To speed up queries with an IVFFlat index, increase the number of inverted lists (at the expense of recall).

```sql
CREATE INDEX ON items USING ivfflat (embedding vector_l2_ops) WITH (lists = 1000);
```

### Vacuuming

Vacuuming can take a while for HNSW indexes. Speed it up by reindexing first.

```sql
REINDEX INDEX CONCURRENTLY index_name;
VACUUM table_name;
```

## Monitoring

Monitor performance with [pg_stat_statements](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/pgstatstatements.html) (be sure to add it to `shared_preload_libraries`).

```sql
CREATE EXTENSION pg_stat_statements;
```

Get the most time-consuming queries with:

```sql
SELECT query, calls, ROUND((total_plan_time + total_exec_time) / calls) AS avg_time_ms,
    ROUND((total_plan_time + total_exec_time) / 60000) AS total_time_min
    FROM pg_stat_statements ORDER BY total_plan_time + total_exec_time DESC LIMIT 20;
```

Note: Replace `total_plan_time + total_exec_time` with `total_time` for Postgres < 13

Monitor recall by comparing results from approximate search with exact search.

```sql
BEGIN;
SET LOCAL enable_indexscan = off; -- use exact search
SELECT ...
COMMIT;
```

## Scaling

Scale pgvector the same way you scale Postgres.

Scale vertically by increasing memory, CPU, and storage on a single instance. Use existing tools to [tune parameters](#tuning) and [monitor performance](#monitoring).

Scale horizontally with [replicas](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/hot-standby.html), or use [Citus](https://github.com/citusdata/citus) or another approach for sharding ([example](https://github.com/pgvector/pgvector-python/blob/master/examples/citus.py)).

## Languages

Use pgvector from any language with a Postgres client. You can even generate and store vectors in one language and query them in another.

## Frequently Asked Questions

#### How many vectors can be stored in a single table?

A non-partitioned table has a limit of 32 TB by default in Postgres. A partitioned table can have thousands of partitions of that size.

#### Is replication supported?

Yes, pgvector uses the write-ahead log (WAL), which allows for replication and point-in-time recovery.

#### What if I want to index vectors with more than 2,000 dimensions?

You’ll need to use [dimensionality reduction](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dimensionality_reduction) at the moment.

#### Can I store vectors with different dimensions in the same column?

You can use `vector` as the type (instead of `vector(3)`).

```sql
CREATE TABLE embeddings (model_id bigint, item_id bigint, embedding vector, PRIMARY KEY (model_id, item_id));
```

However, you can only create indexes on rows with the same number of dimensions (using [expression](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/indexes-expressional.html) and [partial](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/indexes-partial.html) indexing):

```sql
CREATE INDEX ON embeddings USING hnsw ((embedding::vector(3)) vector_l2_ops) WHERE (model_id = 123);
```

and query with:

```sql
SELECT * FROM embeddings WHERE model_id = 123 ORDER BY embedding::vector(3) <-> '[3,1,2]' LIMIT 5;
```

#### Can I store vectors with more precision?

You can use the `double precision[]` or `numeric[]` type to store vectors with more precision.

```sql
CREATE TABLE items (id bigserial PRIMARY KEY, embedding double precision[]);

-- use {} instead of [] for Postgres arrays
INSERT INTO items (embedding) VALUES ('{1,2,3}'), ('{4,5,6}');
```

Optionally, add a [check constraint](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/ddl-constraints.html) to ensure data can be converted to the `vector` type and has the expected dimensions.

```sql
ALTER TABLE items ADD CHECK (vector_dims(embedding::vector) = 3);
```

Use [expression indexing](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/indexes-expressional.html) to index (at a lower precision):

```sql
CREATE INDEX ON items USING hnsw ((embedding::vector(3)) vector_l2_ops);
```

and query with:

```sql
SELECT * FROM items ORDER BY embedding::vector(3) <-> '[3,1,2]' LIMIT 5;
```

#### Do indexes need to fit into memory?

No, but like other index types, you’ll likely see better performance if they do. You can get the size of an index with:

```sql
SELECT pg_size_pretty(pg_relation_size('index_name'));
```

## Troubleshooting

#### Why isn’t a query using an index?

The query needs to have an `ORDER BY` and `LIMIT`, and the `ORDER BY` must be the result of a distance operator, not an expression.

```sql
-- index
ORDER BY embedding <=> '[3,1,2]' LIMIT 5;

-- no index
ORDER BY 1 - (embedding <=> '[3,1,2]') DESC LIMIT 5;
```

You can encourage the planner to use an index for a query with:

```sql
BEGIN;
SET LOCAL enable_seqscan = off;
SELECT ...
COMMIT;
```

Also, if the table is small, a table scan may be faster.

#### Why isn’t a query using a parallel table scan?

The planner doesn’t consider [out-of-line storage](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/storage-toast.html) in cost estimates, which can make a serial scan look cheaper. You can reduce the cost of a parallel scan for a query with:

```sql
BEGIN;
SET LOCAL min_parallel_table_scan_size = 1;
SET LOCAL parallel_setup_cost = 1;
SELECT ...
COMMIT;
```

or choose to store vectors inline:

```sql
ALTER TABLE items ALTER COLUMN embedding SET STORAGE PLAIN;
```

#### Why are there less results for a query after adding an HNSW index?

Results are limited by the size of the dynamic candidate list (`hnsw.ef_search`). There may be even less results due to dead tuples or filtering conditions in the query. We recommend setting `hnsw.ef_search` to at least twice the `LIMIT` of the query. If you need more than 500 results, use an IVFFlat index instead.

#### Why are there less results for a query after adding an IVFFlat index?

The index was likely created with too little data for the number of lists. Drop the index until the table has more data.

```sql
DROP INDEX index_name;
```

Results can also be limited by the number of probes (`ivfflat.probes`).

## Reference

### Vector Type

Each vector takes `4 * dimensions + 8` bytes of storage. Each element is a single precision floating-point number (like the `real` type in Postgres), and all elements must be finite (no `NaN`, `Infinity` or `-Infinity`). Vectors can have up to 16,000 dimensions.
